# Todoist-Task-Dashboard
Created a Power BI dashboard to keep track of completed tasks through IFTTT and Todoist. For some reason the background color in the pdf isn't captured it's not just white I swear.

I used IFTTT to connect the Todois API to google sheets, making it so that everytime I complete a task it automatically gets added to a google sheet. Then I apply some transformations using app script, then Power BI reads from the google sheet. 

In Power BI I preform some more transformations using DAX, and display KPIs. 

This is my first dashboard using Power BI, I think I can improve on the color scheme, along with some other visualization issues. Other than that, creating my own script to get data from the Todoist API to google sheet would be a next step, to make it more dependable and quicker. Overall I got to make something I can use for myself and I also got a nice introduction to Power BI!
